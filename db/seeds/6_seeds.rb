Post.create!(title: "Shooting Horses – Thinking Of You (Plus Spokes Remix)", body: "(Loose Synths) Exciting times ladies and gentlemen, Loose Synths release their first single. Starting life as a music blog, Loose Synths has organically grown over the years to incorporate events and has now evolved into it’s own Music Label. Started by Shooting Horses, Spokes and DLVRY in 2010, the blog soon gained notoriety and it wasn’t long before regular events started and other contributors came on board. The rest, as they say is history. Shooting Horses give us the first offering from the new label. A tasty little number with groovy, warming garage undertones setting off the chopped up vocal. Spokes puts his skills to work on the remix; giving it an industrial deep feel, whist maintaing a high energy to keep any dance floor movin I’ve been friends with these guys for years and I’m stoked to see them making it big. Top DJs, producers and all round good guys. You can get hold of both these tracks now from their website. Enjoy.", soundcloud: "https://soundcloud.com/loosesynths/01-think-of-you", created_at: DateTime.new(2013, , ))

Post.create!(title: "Surkin – Oedo 606", body: "(Marble) Benoit Heitz, or Surkin to you and me, is back. In early 2006 I remember being excited having heard ‘Radio Fireworks‘ for the first time. Since there I haven’t heard much from the young Frenchman. That was until I came across ‘Stronger‘ a few weeks ago. Now he follows up with ‘Oedo 606′, the latest offering from his ‘Advanced Entertainment System’ EP. The Parisian is back to winning ways with this EP. Typically sumptuous French electro house. This track combines ascending melodies with chopped uplifting vocals and signature big electo beats.  Old school feel good French music. In 2011 Surkin got together with Para One and Bobmo to set up their own record label, Marble. No prises for guessing which label he released this EP on then. Its out now so get your hands on a copy; top quality release.", soundcloud: "https://soundcloud.com/surkin/oedo-606", created_at: DateTime.new(2013, , ))

Post.create!(title: "Kwabs – Spirit Fade", body: "Apologies for the lack of recent posts. To make up for it here is a beautiful track from Kwabs. Born Kwabena Adjepong, the London based singer puts out this stunning first single. Dark synth layers and echoing percussion combine with church style organs to complement the exquisite baratone vocals. Spiritual stuff. There isn’t much info around about this young Ghanian, but I’m keeping my fingers crossed for more of the same in the near future.", soundcloud: "https://soundcloud.com/kwabs/spirit-fade", created_at: DateTime.new(2013, , ))

Post.create!(title: "Night Works – Long Forgotten Boy (Erol Alkan Rework)", body: "(Loose Lips) UK based producer, Erol Alkan has had a pretty spectacular career to date. Since starting his London night ‘Trash’ in 1997 Erol hasn’t looked backed. Remixes have included the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip, Scissor Sisters and Justice, to name but a few. In 2006, Erol opened for Daft Punk’s for their live return at Global Gathering – at their personal request. Later this year he was voted number 1 DJ in the world by MixMag. A pretty incredible achievement for an Indie-Dance DJ, when you consider other winners include DJ superstars Paul Van Dyk and Armin Van Buuren. But ask anyone who’s been one of Mr Alkan’s DJ sets, and they’ll confim this is a accolade that is well deserved. The logical next step was Erol’s own label, Phantasy. Launched in 2007 it has released records for artists including Fan Death, Babe, Terror, Gonzales – whose ‘Never Stop’ was used for the worldwide iPad TV ad. This rework is Erol back at his best. I love the woody beat, (reminiscent of Duke Dumont’s ‘The Giver‘) moving into feel good synths. Then the vocal breakdown slowly building up to the magnificent close and fade out. Uplifting house music at it’s finest.", soundcloud: "https://soundcloud.com/erolalkan/night-works-long-forgotten-boy-erol-alkan-rework", created_at: DateTime.new(2013, , ))

Post.create!(title: "Duke Dumont feat. Â*M*E – Need U (100%) (Skream Remix)", body: "I heard a while back that Skream had remixed Duke Dumont’s latest single, ‘Need U (100%)’. I was expecting a big dirty bass filled rework, a la his work on Delphic’s ‘This Momentary‘ or La Roux’s ‘In For The Kill‘. However when I eventually heard I was surprised to say the least. High twinkling synths, soulful vocals and a soul clap tied off with a down right funky bass line. You could be forgiven for thinking that this was the 80′s original that Duke Dumont had remixed for 2013. Take a little listen to Skream’s cheeky preview of his lastest offering on Rudimental ft Angel Haze – ‘Hell Could Freeze’, and you can see this could be a new direction from the Croydon boy. Keep that bass line funky Olly.", soundcloud: "https://soundcloud.com/skreamizm/rudimental-ft-angel-haze-hell", created_at: DateTime.new(2013, , ))

Post.create!(title: "Metal & Dust (Switch Remix)", body: "Regular attenders of the site will be well aware that we a big supports of London Grammar here at MedicinalSounds. Here’s a great little remix of their second single ‘Metal & Dust’ by Switch. Probably best known for his track ‘A Bit Patchy‘ (which has been endlessly remixed), British DJ and producer Switch has established himself as one of the key players in the Fidget House genre. He runs his own label, Dubsided, and in 2006 co-founded Counterfeet with fellow producer Sinden. He has worked closey with M.I.A, producing many of her tracks over the years. More recently Switch has spent most of his time working as one half of Major Lazer until the two parted ways in 2011 after releasing their album, ‘Guns Don’t Kill People . . . Lazers Do’. But you can’t keep a good man down, and here’s the proof. Switch puts a delicious deep house angle on this already sublime track.

Post.create!(title: "HAIM – Falling (Duke Dumont Remix)", body: "(Polydor Records) UK producer, Duke Dumont put his stripped back take on HAIM’s latest single ‘Falling’. Since releasing his epic track, ‘The Giver‘, the Duke followed up with the infectiously catchy ‘Need You (100%)‘ featuring 17 year old  starlet A*M*E. In 2011, he moved out of London to the countryside to focus on his own material rather than remixes. Judging by the aforementioned singles, its would appear as if his has cracked that nut and now puts his remixing skill set back into good use on this project. Cutting down the verses and simplifying the percussion, this rework is simple but so effective.", soundcloud: "https://soundcloud.com/haimtime/haim-falling-duke-dumont", created_at: DateTime.new(2013, , ))

Post.create!(title: "Benga & Kano – Forefather", body: "Columbia Records) After smashing the dance scene apart with Magnetic Man, Benga in ready to do it all again on his own. Well, that is with a little help from some friends he’s made along the way. The first of which is Kano, who features on the first track of the new album, ‘Chapter 2′. Growing up in Croydon, Benga started making music from an early age. In early 2008 he teamed up with Coki to release ‘Night‘, a track often described as one of the breakthrough Dubstep tunes. People started to take note of this new subgenre and it wasn’t long before things blew up for South London producer. Since then he’s formed one third of supergroup Magnetic Man, headlined countless festivals and earned a regular Friday night slot on BBC Radio 1 with fellow DJ Skream. Benga was involved in some controversy last year around the classification of his music, reporting that he didn’t want to be known as Dubstep, as he wanted to keep pushing boundaries. Well apologies Benga, as this is still going in the ‘Dubstep’ category of the site. Don’t get me wrong I have no issue with the man (although his Gucci wellies at Bestival last year have not been forgotten) it’s just the only place it could go. If you like bass heavy music and old school Kano (think back to P’s and Q’s) I think you’ll like this.
