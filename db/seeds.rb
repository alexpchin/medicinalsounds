Cyril Hahn & Javeon – Breaking
Oh yes people, new material from the man Cyril Hahn. The follow up to his first original track ‘Perfect Form‘, comes in the guise of ‘Breaking‘. This time he’s recruited the help of  fellow PMR signing Javeon for vocal duties. It will form part of a new compilation album to be released by PRM, called ‘20 square feet in action‘, with an as yet unconfirmed released date. To celebrate this the legendary London based label have organised a european tour ,headlined by the man himself, Mr Hahn.  Make sure you get hold of a ticket as this will be a rather tasty gig.

BANKS – Brain
Hold up people, here some new stuff from one our firm favourites here on medicinalsounds.com - BANKS. This time the the L.A. beauty has teamed up with yet another key player in electronic scene with Schlomo taking on production duty. Just one more legendary producer to add to the list of artists she’s worked with, and it’s another perfect match. Slow and pensive with echoing claps and deep bass set up the stage for BANKS’ mesmerising vocals. It’s yet another track to get us salivating at the thought of the forthcoming debut album expect later this year.

ASTR – Operate
Time for a bit of sexy synth pop, in the form of NYC duo ASTR and their debut single ‘Operate‘. I’ve been playing this tune on my travels, and smooth 80′s vibes always puts me a good mood. “Call me the Doctor” – seem apt for medicinalsounds.com. If you like this then their latest offering, ‘We Fall Down‘ is another 80′s inspired piece from the same vein. Or check out ‘The Drum Remix‘ for a slowed down, even more sultry version of the original.

Hey Now – London Grammar (Arty Remix)
As mentioned in my previous post there’s a whole host of music I’ve been enjoying over the past few months that I want to get up on the site. So without further ado here’s one of those tracks. It’s an epic remix of Medicinal Sounds’ favourite, London Grammar, by the young Russian Arty. He takes their break through track ‘Hey Now’ and give a tasty reworking making it suitable for the big room. Arty keeps Hannah Reid’s sublime vocals shining through whist adding in deep bass and uplifting synths, all combined to make a really special remix. This tracks been doing the rounds since late last year, so may be old news to some, but hopefully will be a new treat for a few of you.

Embe – Welcome To My House Mix
Apologies loyal followers. It has been all quiet on the Medicinal Sounds front for far too long. With the festivities of Yuletide and a trip to the USA, medicinalsounds.com was sadly neglected. But fear not, as with a new year comes new music and there’s a whole host of tracks that I’ve been listening to that need some love on the site. But back to business, as this post is *fanfare* the 100th post on medicinalsounds.com. So to celebrate here is a mix of my favourite House and Deep House tracks from the blog over the past year. It was recorded live, in one take with no post production editing, so some of the mixing isn’t as tight as I’d like it to be, but I hope you enjoy. Now I’ve finally got my set up working properly, there’ll be more mixes in the near future. Welcome to 2014. Welcome To My House Mix

Hackman – Change My Life
The latest offering from Hackman is sounding real good. ‘Change My Life‘, is a chilled slice of  delicious house that has been getting a lot of plays from myself. The whole EP is beautifully crafted piece of work with deep bass lines balanced against uplifting melodies. If you like this, then check out the remix Hackman did for my friends Eli and Fur track ‘Nightmares‘.

Bonobo – First Fires Ft. Grey Reverend (Maya Jane Coles Remix)
The supremely talented Maya Jane Coles has put her hand to Bonobo’s ‘First Fires‘. Taken from his  album ‘The North Borders’ Coles has put her usual intoxicating deep feel to the track. I can’t think of a remix that Maya has put out that I haven’t played to death, and I feel this one will be no exception. Beautifully deep and augmenting the original quality put down by Bono. Top work once again from both artists.

Metronomy – I’m Aquarius
Indie-dance producer Joe Mount, aka Metronomy is set to release his follow up to ‘The English Riviera‘ in the form of his new album ‘Love Letters‘. Taken from the LP is ‘I’m Aquarius’. It’s a stripped back steady number, which reminds me of Friendly Fire’s ‘Paris’ to a certain extent. Mount started his musical life as a drummer before moving into production, and the clean simple percussion is at the hear of this track. I’m told that you can access the track through the Night Sky mobile app, by locating the Aquarius constellation in the sky. I’ll be honest I haven’t checked if this is true, but free find out and let me know.

Rosie Lowe – Right Thing
(37 Adventures) Here’s some new music from an exciting new talent, Miss Rosie Lowe. The South London based singer has teamed up with Dave Okumu on production to create this number. Its starts of as a stripped back piano ballad, but soon descends into a tripped out etherial piece, not too far removed from some of James Blakes’ earlier work. There is real sense of familiarity when listening to this track, with similarities sure to be drawn to BANKS, but that’s not to take anything away from Rosie’s talent, and there are definitely worse be to be compared to. Looking forward to hearing new stuff from Rosie Lowe soon.

Laura Mvula – Sing To The Moon (Klangkarussell Remix)
(Universal) After their feel good summer smash hit ‘Sonnentanz’, Klangkarussell turn their attention to Laura Mvula’s ‘Sing To The Moon’. The Austrian duo of Tobias Rieser and Adrian Held have taken the Laura’s original and kept things downtempo, whist giving it a smooth warm makeover. With an album currently being created, expect to hear a lot more from Klangkarussel in the near future.
https://soundcloud.com/klangkarussell/sing-to-the-moon-laura-mvula

White Lies – Change (Dawn Golden Remix)
Dawn Golden (aka Dexter Tortoriello) takes on the White Lies’ ode to heartbreak, ‘Change‘. Dawn Golden takes the track deeper, with a catchy melody and alluring synths; epic in every sense. Its another melancholy beautiful piece of work by  Tortiello, and with a full album set to drop early next year, expect to hear from this young man in the near future.

Mass Digital – Feel So Good
(Audio Tonic) Serbian producer Mass Digital, aka Boris Mijolic is set to release his ‘Feel So Good‘ EP on 09/11/13 on Dubai’s Audio Tonic label. The title track of the same name is a slowed down tempo number with acid-tinged bass and entrancing melodies all set around solid drums. Mijolic has been steadily gaining moment in recent years with releases on Neurotraxx, Frequenza and Pacha Recordings. This EP is another statement of intent as Mijolic treads the melodic line between techno and house.

Laura Welsh – Undiscovered (Blonde Remix)
(Outsiders/ Polydor Records) Every so often I get a bit obsessed with a song. At the moment that is happening with the Blonde remix of Laura Welsh’s track ‘Undiscovered‘. It’s one of those delicious house reworks of an already beautiful track that just works. The Bristol based duo of Jake Manson and Adam Englefield have taken the chilled out original and given it a little house work over, with smooth bass line and upped tempo, all the while keeping Laura’s gorgeous vocals shining through. Sounding good.

Moonbeam – Cocoon (Sunset Remix)
Sorry for the lack of activity over the past week, been working some crazy hours to try and get some cash flow in. But back to the matter at hand. Time to add another tune into the ‘Classic Cuts‘ vault. This time its the Russian Khaleev brother’s Moonbeam who take their place, with the Sunset remix of their own track ‘Cocoon‘. It’s dreamy placid reworking as the title suggests, with the beat gently ebbing along before the high bubbling synths come in. This tune has such good memories for me – laying in a park, in the sunshine with a few beers and nothing to do for the rest of the day. Warming thoughts as the weather turns cold here in rainy old England.
https://soundcloud.com/tune-of-the-week/moonbeam-cocoon-sunset-mix

Movement – Us
(Modular) Sydney based trio, Movement, drop their second single ‘Us’. It’s a dark emotive affair and upon closer inspection the lyrics go a little deeper than a lot of other electronic artists around at the moment. The slowed tempo and almost whispered vocals remind me of Jai Paul’s ‘Jasmin‘, which to be fair, is no bad thing. I’ve been playing this to death for the past few weeks and it’s still sounding good.

Breach – Everything You Never Had (Joe Goddard Remix)
(Atlantic Records) As you can probably tell, Medicinal Sounds is undergoing to bit of cosmetic work at the moment. But don’t worry while we give the site a lick of new paint we’ll continue to bring you great new music. As proof here’s the delicious Joe Goddard Remix of Breach’s ‘Everything You Never Had’. The original is the next release from Breach (aka Ben Westbeech) after his summer smash ‘Jack’. It takes a slightly more old school feel, with the soulful vocals of Andreya Triana. Breach has promised a full album release in 2014 which I’m sure many people are waiting for with bated breath. Now onto the remix, let’s be honest Mr Goddard seems to be able to do no wrong at the moment. He has well and truly established himself as one of the heavyweights in House music, whether it be as one half of the Two Bears, playing with Hot Chip, or just by himself as a producer. His take on ‘Everything You Never Had’ is another entry into a pretty flawless and extensive back catalogue. The memorising loop and bird sounds give a warming feeling of calm. Top quality work once again from the big man.

Kyle Watson – Throwback (Black Loops Remix)
Kyle Watson’s new ‘Throwback‘ EP is due for release on 28th October this year. The South African has been rising up the ranks over the past few years, working with various labels before releasing this EP on Gruuv. He brings his trademark rugged house sound to the outfit that will be sure to fit in perfectly. ‘Throwback‘ is comprised of three original tracks and one remix from the Italian born, Berlin based duo Black Loops.  Gruuv’s newest signing put their own spin on ‘Throwback’, giving it a more dubbed out, deeper feel.

James Blake – Life Round Here (Feat. Chance The Rapper)
For those of you who have heard James Blakes‘ ‘Overgrown’ album, the track ‘Life Round Here’, will be old news. However Blake has teamed up with Chicago based Chance The Rapper (aka Chancelor Bennett ) to put a rework on it. True to form, Blake brings his trademark deep melodic yet striped back sounds, complete with dubstep undertones. Chance’s verse breaths fresh life into the track, and the paring seems to fit perfectly. The two have said they would be keen to work together again, so hopefully this is a preview of more to come. The atmospheric black and white video is well worth a watch. It’s directed by Nabil, who has gained respect for his recent work with Kanye West and Frank Ocean. He states that he like to bring juxtapositions to his work, which would explain the lowrider cruising through the English countryside.

Maribou State – Truths (Feat. Jimi Nxir)
(Southern Fried) Maribou State have managed to fox me, in that after their ‘Praise You‘ remix, I was expecting ‘Moon Circles‘ to be their next release after hearing it on their WHP mix they put up on Soundcloud. But here we are a month later and instead we get ‘Truths‘ the title track from their forthcoming EP, complete with the elusive ‘Moon Circles‘. But lets not feel hard done by as this track is certainly no let down. It’s another typically chilled affair from the UK duo, featuring the vocals of Jimi Nxir. Slow steady percussion, twined with laid back guitar, sliding synths and even some strings thrown in there for good measure. The EP is due for release on 21st of October so I guess I’ll just have to wait until then to get ‘Truths‘ and ‘Moon Circles‘ in my library to play out.

Fehrplay – Indigo
(Pryda Friends) Fresh from his set a Tomorrow World last weekend here’s a preview of the sixth release for Fehrplay on the Pryda Friends label. ‘Indigo’ is another deliciously rich piece of progressive house, with a glorious break down which build up to an epic drop. Due for release on October 21st, but you can stream it here until then.

Louis M^ttrs – War With Heaven (Catching Flies Remix)
(MTA Records) Hard day at work? We have the perfect tonic here at Medicinal Sounds courtesy of one our firm favourites , Catching Flies. This time he’s put his remixing skills to work on Louis M^tters’ first single from his new ‘Beachy Head‘ EP, ‘War With Heaven‘. As we’ve come to expect is another effortlessly put together remix that just floats along and helps to wash away the stress. You can watch the thought provoking cinematic video for the original track below. It was directed by the Cannes Film Festival award winning Josh Cole, who was also behind Rudimental’s epic ‘Not Giving In‘.

BANKS – This Is What It Feels Like
(Goodyears) Lil Silva and Jamie Woon have joined forces to produce the latest single from L.A. based singer BANKS. It’s another deep down tempo affair and follows on perfectly from ‘Waiting Game‘, where she enlisted the help of SOHN. You can hear the dub step influence of Woon flowing through the heart of the track. In a relatively short career, BANKS has managed to put together an impressive collection of work joining up with a number of different producers, with tracks like ‘Warm Water’, getting 189,000 views in the first month of it being put online. I like BANKS’ attitude, who by her own admission doesn’t like using social media, but decided to let her fans get in contact by putting up a working mobile number on her Facebook page.

FKA Twigs – Papi Pacify
Here’s the video for the latest single from London based FKA Twigs, ‘Papi Pacify’. Deep, dark and brooding, the video matches the mood of the music. It’s an unnerving video, caught somewhere between raw sexuality and aggression, making for rather unsettling viewing. The track was co-produced by Arca, who has gained notoriety recency for working with Kanye on his Yeezus album. His dark electronic influence runs deep in this one. I’m really liking this follow up to ‘Water Me‘, and I’m keen to see what’s next from Twigs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OydK91JjFOw

The Beloved – Sweet Harmony
Time for another ‘Classic Cut’. This time we go back to 1993 for the biggest single from British band The Beloved. It’s an uplifting synthpop classic complete with sax solo that will be sure to give you a warming sense of inner peace. Possibly. This track has a special memory for me as it was played as the last track at a warehouse rave in Nottingham at about 7am as the sun started to break through the gaps in the windows. Queue chills up the spine.

Steve Rachmad – Bling It Up!
Here’s some laid back tech house to help you through a Monday. This track was released last year by Dutchman Steve Rachmad, and it passed me by until heard it at one of the Boiler Room sessions at Unknown Festival this year. It’s a warming little number, with clean beats, glowing bass and silky smooth synth melodies. I’ll admit I often find tech house a bit cold and soulless, but this is anything but. If the Autumn weather is getting you down, hit play on this one and imagine you’re on a sun drenched terrace in Europe somewhere.

HAIM – The Wire (Tourist Remix)
(Polydor Records)

It’s fair to say that Californian sister trio HAIM have gone from strength to strength since bursting onto scene last year. And with fame comes remixes. Some good, some bad. I’m pleased to say this reworking from Brighton boy Tourist falls into the ‘good’ category.  I first became of aware of Tourist with his 2012 release ‘Placid Acid‘, which got a good few play on my iTunes. His remix of ‘The Wire’ is another upbeat synthy number with filtered vocals that will be sure to get feet tapping. After rediscovering his work I look forward to new material from Tourist, be it original productions or remixes.

Anna Kendrick – Cups (Jellosea remix)
Hello fellow music fans, apologies for the lack of post over the last two weeks. We had a team trip across Europe to Unknown Festival in Croatia. I’m sure any of you who where in attendance will agree that despite a few spots of rain it was a lot of fun. This track was a staple part of my traveling playlist, the Jellosea remix of Anna Kendrick’s single ‘Cups’. The Canadian producer has done a cracking job on this one, and it reminds me of the work of his fellow countryman, Cyril Hahn (who incidentally smashed his set at Unknown). Beautifully chilled house, perfect for a train journey from Hungary to Croatia.

Catching Flies & Ifan Dafydd – Don’t Know How
(Push and Run)

We’re big fans of Catching Flies here at MedicinalSounds.com, so it’s smiles all round when he puts out new material. This time he’s teamed up with Ifan Dafydd for his latest release “Don’t Know How”. It’s a typically laid back affair, with echoing clicks, tinkling piano and floating synths. The track samples the vocals of R&B star Lucy Pearl, and some of that soulful melody still plays through. It forms part of Push and Run’s ‘Tings in Boots’ Volume 2, but the track is available as a free download from his bandcamp page.

Bondax – Giving It All (Joe Goddard Remix)
Sorry for the lack of posts of recent. As our Facebook page will tell you, we’ve been living it up in Ibiza followed directly by SW4 (admittedly ambitious). If like myself you are feeling a tad worse for wear after a weekend of SW4/ Notting Hill Carnival/ Creamfields then we have just the tonic. It comes in the form of a soul soothing remix by Joe Goddard of the Bondax track ‘Giving It All’. The original is great, and I’ve been watching the Bondax boys closely since catching their set at Glastonbury. Add in the remix abilities of Mr Goddard, who appears to have the midas touch, and you have cool late summer smash. Keep checking the Medicinalsounds Facebook page for more content from the aforementioned festivals – anyone else catch Boys Noize’s set?

Martin Garrix – Animals
Here at medicinalsounds.com we often have a slant towards the ambient, chilled out and deep side of electronic music. But every so often we like to mix up and bring you some good old fashioned ‘hand is the air, loose you shit’ kind of track. The kind of track you hear on a big sound system and say ‘Oh dear God, what is this?!’. This number from Dutch producer Martin Garrix is just that. ‘Animals’ was initially uploaded to the web with no artist causing a frenzy of speculation from bloggers and DJs as to who was responsible for this banger. Later it transpired that it was the young prodigy Garrix. Its a really mashup-in-one, and reminds me a bit of Porter Robison’s ‘Unison‘ in that respect. At points you could forgiven for mistakenly thinking it was Tiesto trace special, and then but 30 seconds later it goes dark and minimal enough to be a Dirtybird release. One thing is for sure, you can hear the dirty Dutch influence. I am fully aware that into their dance music will have heard this by now, but if not, well you’re in for a treat.

Hayden James – Permission To Love (Charles Murdoch Remix)
(Future Classic) Want more free music? You got it, this time from Charles Murdoch with his remix of Hayden James’ ‘Permission To Love’. Slow rolling, this track is somehow laid back and relaxed whist also sounding big and punchy at the same time. Top work from the Aussie lad. If you want to know a bit more about him have a read of the interview he did for DJmag.
https://soundcloud.com/futureclassic/hayden-james-permission-to-6

Joel Compass – Astronaut (Ghost Loft Remix)
(Black Butter) Here’s an appropriately spaced out remix of Joel Compass’s ‘Astronaut‘. The L.A based producer has only been making music for about a year as far as I can tell, and I can’t actually find much info about him online. However a quick listen to his Soundcloud pages shows this work is typical of his style. Warming, downtempo and smooth. Expect this to feature in one of my ‘Soul Ironing’ mixes soon. If you want something with a bit more bite, check out the Gorgon City Remix, for a deep house reworking. Due for forthcoming release on Black Butter Records, who are putting out so much good music at the moment. I recommend a look at their recent releases for a couple of gems.

Shigeto – What U Really Needed
The only thing better than finding a great new tune, is finding a great new tune that the producer is giving away for free. And that’s exactly what we have here from Shigeto. A beautiful, winding, other worldly piece of ambient house. It features the vocals of Brandon Mitchell and Carlos Garcia, and is perfect if you’re looking to unwind after a hectic day. Get hold of copy from Detroit man’s Soundcloud page without fear of any pesky copyright layers knocking on your door. But then all of our readers get their music by legal means anyway...

Burial – Archangel
(Hyperdub)
It’s time to add another selection to our ‘Classic Cuts‘. This time we give up the position to the enigmatic Burial. Despite critical acclaim for both of his first two albums as well as a mercury music nomination, little was known about the man from South London. In 2008 he posted a picture of himself on his Myspace and dispelled rumours of Norman Cook or Richard D James being behind the music. It was in fact Mr William Bevan, and he explained that he was a “lowkey guy” who “just wanted to make some tunes”. And so he has. This track is just one classic of many in his collection.  If this is the only single of his you’ve heard, I strongly urge you to go through his back catalogue. ‘Archangel’ is taken from his 2007 album ‘Untrue’. I appreciate that it’s highly unlikely that this will be the first time anyone has head this tune, however I hope that it will remind you just how good it is. A fitting soundtrack to the recent weather change.

Boynextdoor – The Magical Mystery Tour
My good friend and coworker Dan Bendal, aka Boynextdoor has just put the finishing touches on this upbeat electro house number. He informs me that it was started 3 years ago, but he’s only just come back, reworked it and it’s now ready for the the world to hear. Dan is qualified doctor, so his track makes a fitting addition to medicinalsounds.com. He’s also giving this track away free on his Soundcloud page. I just hope we’re not waiting 3 years for the next one Dan.
https://soundcloud.com/boynextdoor/boynextdoor-the-magical

Phaeleh – Storm (Ft. Jess Mills)
Fancy a bit of deep moody dubstep? Well you’re in luck. It comes in the form of Bristol based producer Phaeleh, and features the vocal talents of young Jess Mills. The name may be familiar if you like your dubstep as she was the vocalist for Breakage’s ‘Fighting Fire‘, and has had her singles remixed by various DJ’s, including Phaeleh himself on her track ‘For My Sins‘. The video is a tad ’90′s cliche, but we’re all here for the music and not girls in short shorts. Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt3C85D7cY8

Eli & Fur – You’re So High
Here’s the lead track off the new EP from my good friends Eli & Fur. It’s another tantalisingly melodic house number. Smooth and silky on the ears with just enough bite from bass running beneath. This will be sure to get some heads nodding this summer. The EP is due for release on the 22nd July, available on beatport. If you like this; check out their track ‘Nightmares‘, complete with it’s own Hackman remix.

Fehrplay – Talk To Me
(Pryda Friends) Here’s the new one from Fehrplay, ‘Talk To Me‘. Having steadily built his reputation to become one of the key players in house music, Fehrplay comes good once again. I’ve been meaning to put one of his tracks up on the site for a while, but just haven’t got round to it until now. A slightly more tech sound than his previous work, it reminds me a bit of Scuba’s recent stuff, but with it’s own unique twist. My good friend Kid Booka put me onto this young Norweigen a while ago and his whole back catalogue is well worth checking out. To be released on the Scandinavian rich ‘Prydra Friends’ label on 29th of July.

Kidnap Kid – Survive
(Black Butter Records) I’ve been aware of Kidnap Kid aka Matt Relton for a while now, but haven’t been blown away by his work to date. Don’t get me wrong; I don’t hate it (and you don’t become iTunes ‘Best Electronic Song of 2012′ as he did with ‘Vehl’ without some serious talent), I just felt his tunes were lacking something. And I think this track has found that something. ‘Survive’ is 7 minute 30 second piece of beautifully crafted deep house. The off beat lick, the soulful vocals, the uplifting melodies, the deep rolling bass – all the elements perfectly combined to make a delicious piece of house music. Congratulations Mr Relton; you’ve just gained a new fan.

Dusky – Mr Man
I know, I know, yet another post about Dusky!? Well I’m afraid so good readers. And after seeing them at Glastonbury and then hearing this new track and can assue you it’s a case of credit where credit is due. This latest offering from the duo is sublime once again. The warming bass line giving way to a sparse and haunting piano breakdown, before slowing bringing in the snare and building the track back up. Deep glowing house music from one of my favorite producer duo’s around. Due for release as part of Anjunadeep 05 on 27/07/13.

J.Rabbit – Tequila Remix
(Spinnin’ Records) Hello ladies and gents, apologies for the lack of posts over the last week or so. I like about 100,000 other music lovers was at Glastonbury. If you weren’t lucky enough to get a ticket we’ve added some content to our Facebook page to give you a very small taste of what went on. While you’re there why not give us a ‘Like’. Anyway back to business, whist stumbling around in a drunken haze on Saturday morning on the way back to my camp site, I came across a little stage playing a heady mix of house, dubstep, trap and disco. I have no idea who the DJ was but he dropped this ‘Tequila’ trap remix and it went off.  So here it is for all to enjoy.

Catching Flies – The Long Journey Home EP
(Indigo Soul) Catching Flies latest EP, ‘The Long Journey Home’ is simply sublime. The 22 year old made a big impression with his first EP ‘The Stars’ last year. This follow up is top quality, down tempo music, with all three tracks delivering the goods. The two remix aren’t half bad either. Available now, get hold of a copy and see for yourself.

Disclosure – You & Me (Flume Remix)
Disclosure really are flying high right now. Headlining festivals, curating an upcoming Warehouse project and a number one album to boot. As a result its hardly surprising that they’re THE act to remix at the moment. I was sold hook, line and sinker on the Baauer Remix of ‘You & Me‘, but this reworking from Australian producer Flume has given me food for thought. Less frantic in it’s nature, the track takes on a more glich hop style, that works really nicely. I eagerly await more from Flume in the near future.

Booka Shade – In White Rooms
(Get Physical Music) Every 10th post here on Medicinal Sounds we like add to our ‘Classic Cuts‘ section. So here to join those already in the hall of fame is Booka Shade with ‘In White Rooms‘. The German house duo is comprised of Walter Merziger and Arno Kammermeier. They’ve been described as veterans of the German electronic music scene, and are renowned for their visually impressive shows; wowing audiences with percussion and re workings live on stage. This is a gorgeously simple track that slowly builds in intensity, never quite reaching the frantic crescendo that much of todays producers do; but that in itself is part of the charm. For me this was the standout track on their ‘Movements’ album, but if you want something something  a bit more jacking, have a listen to ‘Blue Rooms‘ for a techier reworking. Originally released back in May 2006 it sounds as good today as it did then. If you like this check out ‘Mandarine Girl‘, ‘Body Language‘, or any of the rest of their back catalogue.

Kings Of Leon – Closer (No One 32 Remix)
Here’s a nice little remix of my favorite Kings Of Leon track ‘Closer’, courtesy of No One 32. I can’t find out much about this German DJ/ producer, other than his real name, Andreas Leitel, on his Soundcloud page. It puts a nice deep house spin on the track whist keeping Caleb Followill’s emotional vocals at the heart of the tune.

It’s two for two with Dusky here on medicinalsounds.com, with two mentions in as many posts. This time they take on Will Saul’s alias – Close. They give the melodic deep house treatment to his second single ‘My Way’, taken from forthcoming album ‘Get Closer’. Just further proof of Dusky’s ability and intent. Smooth deep house vibes, whilst keeping Joe Dukie’s vocals (of Fatt Freddie’s Drop) clean and true. Sounding good on a sunny evening.

Dusky – Vanishing Point
(Naked Naked) Here’s the latest single from Dusky, the London based duo comprised of Alfie Granger-Howell and Nick Harriman. Formerly known as Solarity, the pair may have changed their name but are still producing their distinctive rich melodic sound. This track is no exception with it’s warm deep bass line and steady hi-hat ticking through this is sure to have the dance floors moving. It froms part of their forthcoming EP of the same name, due for release on 03/06/13. You can stream a preview on their Soundclound page now. If you like this check out their remix of Justin Martin’s ‘Don’t Go‘.

Fatboyslim – Praise You (Maribou State Remix)
(Skint Records) It takes a brave individual to take on a stone cold classic like Norman Cook’s ‘Praise You’. In this case it took two, in the form of Maribou State. I first heard of this duo on their collaboration with Pedestrian – ‘Mask‘. This reworking is an equally ambient and floating affair to start with before adding in those classic vocals and slowly building up the energy. It appears fortune does indeed favour the brave. Available for download on Beatport now.

Disclosure – When A Fire Starts To Burn
(PMR Records) It’s fair to say the Disclosure boys are gaining rather a large fan base. With their album still unreleased, they managed to get over 40,000 plays of this track in the first hour of uploading it to their soundcloud! ‘When A Fire Starts To Burn’ is the latest track to be previewed from the Lawrence brothers’ ‘Settle’ album due for release on 03/06/13. Apparently the boys found the sample for the track by typing “motivational speaker Harlem” into iTunes. The aim to was to collaborate with a rapper, but I feel this sample has worked out rather well instead. The tune is slightly more minimal take on the melodic house they’ve become renowned for. If you manage to get hold of tickets to their secret album launch party, feel free to invite us.

Retrograde (Finn Pilly Edit)
Here’s a cracking edit of James Blake’s ‘Retrograde’ by Finn Pilly, a.k.a. Finnebassen. I’ve been a fan of this Norwegian since hearing ‘Touching Me‘ for the first time in Ibiza last year. Since then releases including ‘Such A High‘, ‘If You Only Knew‘ and his cover of Prince’s ‘When Doves Cry‘ have made him one of my favorite downtempo producers. Here he takes the originally sobre ‘Retrograde’ and turns it into a sexy deep house classic, all the while maintaining Blake’s sublime vocals. You can download a copy for free from his Soundcloud. Happy Days.

Hervé – Lose Control (feat. Seasfire)
This track passed me by when it was released, but I’m glad a stumbled across it on Herve’s soundcloud. It’s a mesmerising, floating piece of music from the head of ‘Cheap Thrills label’. Taken from the album ‘The Art Of Disappearing’ which also features guest performances from Katie Stelmanis of Austra, Maria Minerva and Niki & The Dove. It’s out now so go and get hold of a copy.

Disclosure – You & Me ft. Eliza Doolittle (Baauer Remix)
He’s at it again. This time Baauer has taken on the British brothers, Disclosure, and their latest offering featuring Eliza Doolittle. Like so many of the good new tunes emerging at the moment this was previewed at Coachella and has now made its way onto the web for all to enjoy. Following the success of his remix of AlunaGeorge’s ‘Attracting Flies‘, Baauer has decided rework another of the UK’s hottest electronic acts in Disclosure. He pushes up the tempo, shifts the pitch on the vocals and adds a sprinkling of his trademark Trap style to tie it all together. Slightly different sound here from Baauer, and I like it. A lot. Available for download on 21st of May. Stream it here until then. If you’re after something a bit funkier, check out the original version below. Warming garage vibes.

Raffertie – Benediction
Stirring cover from Raffertie of Hot Natured’s ‘Benediction’. The British boss of micro label ‘Super Recordings’ puts a deeper twist on one of last years summer smashes. With a deep kick drum at the heart of the track and smooth vocals, this is a effortlessly cool tune. You can download the track for free from the Mixmag soundcloud page. What a treat.

It comes from head honcho at Dirtybird, Calude VonStroke and his classic track ‘Who’s Afraid Of Detroit?’. Deep dark Detroit techo at it’s finest.
